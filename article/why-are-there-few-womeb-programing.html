                    I remember that when I started to study computing and informatics at the institute we were only 3 women out of 35 students, most of them were men, today that I am in a programming bootcamp we are only 5 women out of 40 students and so we can still find that difference, but what happens, why are there few women? Or perhaps the question is "<strong><i>Why are women still not interested in learning to code?</i></strong>"

                <p class="content-lg article-paragraph">
                    The reasons can be several, one of them the social aspect, since childhood we have seen how stereotypes are generated and we are grouped together for certain purposes, to the point of defining that certain professions are especially for women or men, an example of this is that Studying secretarial would look better on a female than a male.

                <p class="content-lg article-paragraph">
                    Another point is the lack of visibility of leading women in technology, I had to buy a book that talks about innovative women "Goodnight story for rebellious girls" to know that Ada Lovace is considered the first programmer in history, And just like her, there are many more stories about how women have contributed to technological advancement.

                        “Although technology is consumed by both men and women, it is created only by men. If we want technology to be able to respond to the needs of women, we need to have diverse teams.”

                    According to IDB studies, in the world only 10% of women choose to study a STEM career. In Peru, only 29% of women are inclined to choose a career in technology.

                <p class="content-lg article-paragraph">
                    This year, UNICEF, together with Laboratoria (programming bootcamp focused on women), developed a diagnosis with female students in North Lima, in two CETPROS. One of the first barriers is inside your own home. "More than 30% of those consulted indicated that women are expected to dedicate themselves to something else and not to technological careers and just over 53% of them should dedicate between two and four hours a day to perform household tasks"

                    This same study indicates that due to these factors, girls and adolescents do not contemplate the idea of ​​enrolling in STEM areas. 59.8% of those who participated in the study said they did not feel capable of pursuing a career in these areas.

                    Although work is being done to bridge this gap and inspire more women to work in the tech world, there is still a long way to go.
